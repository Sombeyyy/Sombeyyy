### ðŸ‘‹ Hi There! I'm Sombeyyy

More information coming soon...
<p>
    I'm Bastian - better known on the Internet as Sombeyyy. I'm currently in an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for system integration. <br>
    In my free time, I enjoy reading up on a wide range of IT topics and trying them out. I have also discovered my love for
    Docker and would like to deepen my knowledge here. <br>
    I also implement various programming projects in my free time, which should make future projects easier for me in the future.
    Some of them will be available open source here.
